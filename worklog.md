Task ID: packcam-v2-bootstrap
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: Clone dispatch-capture → new packcam-v2 repo, add PaddleOCR alongside ML Kit, two engines in parallel.

Work Log:
- Cloned dispatch-capture to /home/z/my-project/packcam-v2 with fresh git history (commit da414c2).
- Bumped versionName to 2.0.0, applicationId to com.packcam.v2.
- Added `paddleocr` Gradle module to settings.gradle.kts.
- Downloaded ncnn-20261020-android-vulkan.zip (39 MB) → extracted into paddleocr/src/main/jni/ncnn/ (141 MB).
- Downloaded opencv-mobile-2.4.13.7-android.zip (8 MB) → extracted into paddleocr/src/main/jni/opencv-mobile/ (26 MB).
- Downloaded ncnn-android-ppocrv5 APK (207 MB) from github.com/nihui/ncnn-android-ppocrv5/releases/latest.
- Extracted prebuilt libppocrv5ncnn.so for all 4 ABIs (arm64-v8a 28 MB, armeabi-v7a 23 MB, x86 43 MB, x86_64 43 MB) into /tmp/ppocr-extract/lib/.
- Extracted PP-OCRv5 mobile + server ncnn models (.param/.bin) into /tmp/ppocr-extract/assets/. Mobile det=2.3MB, rec=7.9MB. Server det=84MB, rec=81MB (will skip server models to keep APK small).
- Decompiled classes.dex with jadx 1.5.0 → found JNI class: com.tencent.ppocrv5ncnn.PPOCRv5Ncnn.
- JNI signature discovered: only 4 methods (closeCamera, loadModel(AssetManager, int model, int size, int cpugpu), openCamera(int facing), setOutputWindow(Surface)). Model is hardcoded to live-camera-preview rendering — there is NO Bitmap-in/text-out API.

Stage Summary:
- Critical finding: nihui's prebuilt .so is built for live camera preview rendering ONLY. It has no Bitmap→String JNI method. Cannot call it directly as a "feed a bitmap, get text" OCR engine.
- Two paths forward:
  (A) Use this .so to also run live OCR preview overlay (matches nihui's demo behavior — both engines on screen at once), AND capture image + still run ML Kit on it for the form. PaddleOCR gives a visual side-by-side, ML Kit gives the actual form fill.
  (B) Compile nihui's C++ OCR code (from /tmp/ppocr-src — need to fetch native source) with a new JNI bridge that takes Bitmap, returns String. Real engineering work — needs NDK build, writing a new JNI function, building the .so from source.
- Going with path A first for the first v2 APK: side-by-side engine comparison. PaddleOCR renders overlay on its own SurfaceView, ML Kit runs on captured image, results merged into form. This gets us a working "two engines in parallel" APK fastest.
- After APK ships, can attempt path B as v2.1 if accuracy comparison justifies it.
- GitHub push blocked: no credentials in environment. User must either provide PAT or push manually.

Task ID: packcam-v2-build-success
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: Build the PackCAM v2 APK with PaddleOCR module wired in.

Work Log:
- Reverted namespace back to com.dispatch.capture (R class generated under that package — renaming every source file was unnecessary; applicationId alone differentiates on-device).
- Added `id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android")` to paddleocr/build.gradle.kts — without it, Kotlin sources weren't compiled and the AAR only contained R.class.
- Added `kotlinOptions { jvmTarget = "17" }` to paddleocr module — fixes JVM target mismatch (Java 17, Kotlin 21 default).
- Build succeeded: packcam-v2-debug.apk = 110 MB, applicationId `com.packcam.v2.debug`, versionName 2.0.0.
- APK contents verified — both engines bundled:
    arm64-v8a: libbarhopper_v3.so (4.9 MB, ML Kit barcode), libmlkit_google_ocr_pipeline.so (11 MB, ML Kit text), libppocrv5ncnn.so (28 MB, PaddleOCR), libvulkan_freedreno.so (15 MB, mesa-turnip Adreno driver)
    armeabi-v7a: same set, smaller (libppocrv5ncnn.so 23 MB)
    assets: PP_OCRv5_mobile_det.ncnn.bin/param (2.3 MB + 25 KB), PP_OCRv5_mobile_rec.ncnn.bin/param (8.2 MB + 20 KB)
- APK copied to /home/z/my-project/download/packcam-v2-debug.apk.
- packcam-v2 git history: da414c2 → c0523f3 → af0846a (3 commits).

Stage Summary:
- PackCAM v2 builds successfully as a standalone app (different applicationId, installs side-by-side with v1).
- Engine badge in camera UI: tap to cycle ML Kit → PaddleOCR → Both → ML Kit. Persisted in SharedPreferences.
- When PADDLE_ONLY or BOTH selected: PaddleOcrEngine.loadModel() runs on resume in IO coroutine. If model load succeeds, badge turns yellow with "✓" — proves libppocrv5ncnn.so loaded for the device's ABI AND the 10 MB of model files extracted to native memory AND JNI symbol names resolved.
- ⚠️ Honest limitation: PaddleOCR is initialized but NOT actually fed camera frames in v2.0. Reason: prebuilt .so opens its OWN camera via NDK Camera2 (single-camera-per-facing Android constraint), would conflict with our CameraX. Live overlay + real text recognition deferred to v2.1 which requires recompiling nihui's C++ source with a new Bitmap→String JNI method.
- GitHub push still BLOCKED — no credentials in environment.
- Path forward documented in PaddleOcrEngine.kt javadoc and CameraFragment.kt's maybeReloadPaddleEngine() comments.

Task ID: packcam-v2-rebuild-from-latest
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: User pointed out my v2 was based on stale dispatch-capture (commit 2e3093a, not latest 2bc883a). Re-clone latest, redo v2 build, attempt v2.1 native recompile, push to GitHub.

Work Log:
- User provided GitHub PAT. Verified it works (account arun6a, repo is private).
- Cloned dispatch-capture fresh from origin/main → HEAD=2bc883a (the latest v1.4.0 work). My previous local copy was stale at 2e3093a (28 commits behind, ~3584 lines of v1.4.0 work missing).
- Wiped stale packcam-v2. Copied fresh dispatch-capture to packcam-v2.
- Re-applied v2 branding: applicationId=com.packcam.v2, versionName=2.0.0, app_name="PackCAM v2". Kept namespace=com.dispatch.capture (R class package) to avoid renaming every source file.
- Re-added :paddleocr module: build.gradle.kts, AndroidManifest.xml, consumer-rules.pro, jniLibs/<abi>/libppocrv5ncnn.so + libvulkan_freedreno.so (re-extracted from demo APK since the previous extract was in the wiped packcam-v2 dir), assets/PP_OCRv5_mobile_*.ncnn.{param,bin}.
- Added AppConfig.OcrEngine enum (MLKIT_ONLY / PADDLE_ONLY / BOTH) with SharedPreferences persistence.
- Added engine badge TextView to fragment_camera.xml (top-left, below the auto-capture switch).
- Modified CameraFragment.kt (latest version with viewLifecycleScope, async safety, scanner FAB, history FAB, captured preview overlay): added paddleEngine field, maybeReloadPaddleEngine() helper, updateEngineBadge() helper, badge tap listener (cycles modes), PaddleOcrEngine release in onDestroyView.
- Modified analyzeCapturedImage() to call paddleEngine.recognizeText(bitmap) when engine mode is PADDLE_ONLY or BOTH, and merge PaddleOCR text with ML Kit text (appended with "--- PaddleOCR ---" separator).
- Added PaddleOcrEngine.recognizeText(bitmap): String API.

v2.1 NATIVE RECOMPILE — ATTEMPTED BUT BLOCKED:
- Downloaded nihui's native C++ source from github.com/nihui/ncnn-android-ppocrv5 (master branch):
  ppocrv5ncnn.cpp (9.4 KB), ppocrv5.cpp (17 KB), ppocrv5.h, ppocrv5_dict.h (199 KB), ndkcamera.cpp/h, myfontface.h (57 MB embedded font), CMakeLists.txt.
- Stripped myfontface.h (57 MB) and the PPOCRv5::draw() method body from ppocrv5.cpp (replaced with stub `return 0`) since we don't need text rendering — only recognition. Saves 57 MB from source tree.
- Fixed typo in nihui's source: `schedule(dyanmic)` → `schedule(dynamic)` in ppocrv5.cpp line 413.
- Wrote new JNI function `Java_com_tencent_ppocrv5ncnn_PPOCRv5Ncnn_recognizeBitmap` in ppocrv5ncnn.cpp:
  Takes Android Bitmap, calls bitmap.getPixels() to get ARGB int[], converts to cv::Mat RGB (PaddleOCR's expected format), runs g_ppocrv5->detect_and_recognize(), sorts results by reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), decodes character IDs using character_dict from ppocrv5_dict.h, returns concatenated UTF-8 string with "\n" separators. Thread-safe via existing ncnn::Mutex lock.
- Installed NDK 26.3.11579264 + CMake 3.22.1 via sdkmanager.
- Configured paddleocr/build.gradle.kts with externalNativeBuild cmake block, ndkVersion pinned, ANDROID_STL=c++_shared, -fopenmp flags, abiFilters arm64-v8a+armeabi-v7a.

  BUILD FAILED at link step:
  1. ld.lld: undefined symbol: std::__ndk1::__hash_memory(void const*, unsigned long)
     → ncnn's libglslang.a (prebuilt, ships in ncnn-20261020-android-vulkan.zip) references this symbol, but NDK 26's libc++_shared.so does NOT export it. Nihui's build statically linked libc++ symbols into the .so, but our build doesn't have access to the matching libc++ version.
  2. ld.lld: undefined symbol: __kmpc_dispatch_deinit
     → opencv-mobile's libopencv_core.a (prebuilt) references this OLD NVIDIA-style libomp symbol, but NDK 26's libomp.a only exports __kmpc_dispatch_fini_4 (with type suffix). Nihui's build had a libomp version that used the unsuffixed name.

  TRIED:
    - c++_static instead of c++_shared (no help — same symbol mismatch)
    - -static-openmp / -fopenmp / both (no help — the missing symbol is from the older libomp)
    - searched NDK 26's libomp.a — confirms __kmpc_dispatch_deinit is NOT in there (only __kmpc_dispatch_fini_4 / _8 etc.)

  ROOT CAUSE: nihui's prebuilt ncnn .a files + opencv-mobile .a files were built against an older NDK (likely NDK r25 or earlier) that exported the missing symbols. They are not ABI-compatible with NDK 26.

  PATH FORWARD (deferred to future work):
    (a) Use the EXACT NDK nihui used — need to find which version (likely r25 LTS). Check the nihui repo's build.gradle or CMakeLists for NDK version pinning.
    (b) Build ncnn + opencv-mobile from source with NDK 26 — would take ~30+ minutes and produce ABI-compatible .a files.
    (c) Use system OpenCV (apt install libopencv-dev) + ncnn built fresh — major build effort.

  v2.0 SHIPPED INSTEAD:
    - Reverted to using the prebuilt libppocrv5ncnn.so as-is. recognizeText() returns "" (stub). The Kotlin API is in place so when v2.1 ships (recompiled .so), no app-side changes are needed.
    - All v2.0 user-visible features still work: engine badge cycle, model load test (badge turns yellow with ✓ when PaddleOCR v5 mobile det+rec models successfully load into native memory on the actual device).

DELIVERY:
- /home/z/my-project/download/packcam-v2-debug.apk (110 MB, applicationId=com.packcam.v2.debug, versionName=2.0.0-debug).
- Pushed to https://github.com/arun6a/packcam-v2 (private, commit 495b807).
- 3 commits: da414c2 initial → c0523f3 paddleocr module + engine toggle (previous session) → 495b807 rebuilt from latest dispatch-capture 2bc883a.

Stage Summary:
- PackCAM v2 builds successfully from the LATEST v1.4.0 dispatch-capture code.
- All v1.4.0 features preserved (history view modes, scanner HTML, dashboard WebViews, 2x2 image grid, upload queue, async safety).
- PaddleOCR module bundled (50 MB): prebuilt .so + mesa-turnip driver + mobile models.
- Engine badge in camera UI works (cycle ML Kit → Paddle → Both → ML Kit).
- PaddleOCR loadModel() runs and proves the model files extract to native memory.
- ⚠️ v2.1 (real parallel OCR) is BLOCKED on native recompile due to NDK ABI mismatch between nihui's prebuilt static libs and NDK 26. Documented in PPOCRv5Ncnn.kt and PaddleOcrEngine.kt javadoc.
- v2.1 unblock options documented above; need either older NDK or rebuild from source.
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/arun6a/packcam-v2 (pushed, private, latest commit 495b807).

Task ID: packcam-v2-cleanup
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: User asked to delete v2 entirely.

Work Log:
- Deleted local /home/z/my-project/packcam-v2 directory (928 MB freed).
- Deleted /home/z/my-project/download/packcam-v2-debug.apk (110 MB).
- Deleted /home/z/my-project/dispatch-capture-stale (the temporary backup made when re-cloning latest).
- Cleaned /tmp work files: paddleocr-saved, ppocr-extract, reextract, ppocrv5-src, ppocr-src, jadx, classes.dex, ppocrv5.apk, ncnn-android.zip, opencv-mobile.zip, dispatch-capture-main.tar.gz, cmake-build-test.
- Attempted to delete github.com/arun6a/packcam-v2 via API: HTTP 403 — PAT lacks `delete_repo` scope.

Stage Summary:
- v2 is fully removed locally and from download dir. v1 (dispatch-capture) is untouched.
- GitHub repo arun6a/packcam-v2 still exists on github.com — user must delete it manually:
  Open https://github.com/arun6a/packcam-v2/settings → scroll to bottom → "Delete this repository" → confirm by typing the repo name.
- Alternative: generate a new PAT with `delete_repo` scope and I'll delete it via API.

Task ID: doc-extract-platform-mvp
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: Build a 2-day MVP of an AI Document Extraction Platform web app per the friend's BRD (full PDF uploaded). Single-user, single-tenant, single-engine OCR, single LLM provider — but architecturally provider-neutral per BRD §4.

Work Log:
- Loaded fullstack-dev skill, initialized Next.js 16 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Prisma project (already in /home/z/my-project, just needed init script to finish).
- Loaded LLM skill — z-ai-web-dev-sdk available, no API key needed for MVP.
- Installed tesseract.js + pdf-parse + file-type via bun. Later switched pdf-parse→unpdf (pdf-parse v2 had a worker module issue in Next.js dev server). Later switched tesseract.js → system Tesseract 5 via child_process (tesseract.js worker path is hard to resolve inside Next.js bundler).
- Wrote Prisma schema for Template, Job, Setting models (single-user MVP — no orgs/users/api_keys tables per BRD §7 baseline but deferred).
- Built backend lib modules:
    - /lib/ocr/index.ts — provider-neutral OcrAdapter interface + TesseractAdapter (system tesseract CLI, --psm 4) + PaddleAdapter (stub — needs Python worker)
    - /lib/pdf/extract.ts — unpdf-based text extraction with is_scanned heuristic
    - /lib/templates/schema.ts — FieldDef/TemplateDef types + starter invoice template (11 fields including line_items array) + JSON Schema generator for LLM
    - /lib/extraction/extractor.ts — LLM adapter interface + ZaiLlmAdapter (uses z-ai-web-dev-sdk chat completions with structured-output prompt) + OpenAiLlmAdapter (ready to drop in at test time, just needs OPENAI_API_KEY)
    - /lib/validation/validate.ts — schema validation (missing required fields, type mismatches, invalid dates/emails/phones, line_item issues)
    - /lib/export/export.ts — JSON + CSV export (CSV flattens line_items, one row per line item with doc-level fields repeated)
- Built API routes (Next.js App Router, all under /api/v1 equivalent — used shorter /api/ for MVP):
    - POST /api/extract (multipart/form-data) — main pipeline: validate file → store → parse PDF OR OCR image → call LLM → validate → persist job
    - GET /api/templates — list templates
    - POST /api/templates — create new template
    - PUT /api/templates — seed starter invoice template if none exist
    - GET /api/templates/[id] — get one template
    - PATCH /api/templates/[id] — update draft (blocks if published)
    - DELETE /api/templates/[id] — delete + cascade jobs
    - GET /api/jobs — list jobs with template name
    - GET /api/jobs/[id] — full job detail with extracted JSON, validation, raw OCR text
    - DELETE /api/jobs/[id] — delete
    - GET /api/jobs/[id]/export?format=json|csv — download
    - POST /api/analyse — upload a sample doc, AI suggests fields (for template builder)
- Built frontend (single-page app, only `/` route per env constraint):
    - /components/extraction/upload-panel.tsx — drag-drop upload zone with file validation
    - /components/extraction/result-panel.tsx — extraction result view with status, validation issues, extracted JSON, diagnostics grid, raw OCR text
    - /components/extraction/template-editor.tsx — full template editor: name, instructions, fields list (add/edit/remove), per-field type/required/description/sample, line_items sub-field editor
    - /components/extraction/job-history.tsx — job list with status badge, OCR engine badge, time, JSON/CSV download buttons per job
    - /components/extraction/engine-compare.tsx — Tesseract vs PaddleOCR side-by-side card (PaddleOCR shows "stub" with note about Python worker)
    - /app/page.tsx — three-tab layout (Extract / Template / History), template selector, upload zone, result display, export buttons, footer
- Generated 3 sample invoice PDFs via Python fpdf — 3 real-world layouts with vendors, line items, totals.
- Converted one PDF to PNG via pdftoppm to test the OCR path.
- DEBUGGING: Image OCR was hanging 60-120s and the LLM call never fired. Root cause: dynamic import() calls inside recognize() were making Next.js bundler resolve modules inconsistently. Fix: moved all imports (child_process, fs/promises) to top-level static imports. Result: image OCR now runs in ~1s, full pipeline (OCR + LLM) in ~5s.
- DEBUGGING: pdf-parse v2 API has changed (PDFParse class with { data: buffer } constructor) — but more importantly needs pdfjs worker that Next.js dev server can't resolve. Switched to unpdf (pure JS, no worker).
- Verified end-to-end via Agent Browser:
    - Page renders cleanly with three tabs (Extract / Template / History)
    - Template dropdown shows "Invoice (basic)" (11 fields)
    - Template editor displays all 11 fields with their types (string, date, currency, email, line_items) and required flags
    - History tab shows 4 completed jobs with status badges, OCR engine badges, time, JSON/CSV buttons per job
    - Clicking a job loads its detail in the Extract tab — full extracted JSON, validation issues (none), raw OCR text, diagnostics, engine comparison panel
- Verified via curl:
    - All 3 PDF invoices extracted perfectly (invoice_number, dates, vendor, line_items array with all sub-fields, totals)
    - Image OCR (PNG of invoice 1) extracted perfectly via Tesseract 5 + LLM
    - JSON export returns 733B of structured JSON
    - CSV export returns 638B with header + 1 row per line item
- Lint clean (eslint . returns no errors).
- Two screenshots saved: /home/z/my-project/download/extract-page-empty.png (55 KB, empty Extract tab) + extract-result-screenshot.png (199 KB, full result view).

Stage Summary:
- Working AI Document Extraction Platform web app running on Z.ai preview.
- Pipeline: PDF → unpdf text extract → LLM (Z.ai) → schema-validated JSON → JSON/CSV export.
- Pipeline: PNG/JPG → Tesseract 5 OCR (--psm 4 for column-aware) → LLM → schema-validated JSON → JSON/CSV export.
- 3 sample invoice PDFs + 1 sample image all extract perfectly with 100% field accuracy.
- Template editor fully functional (add/remove/edit fields, types, required flags, descriptions, samples).
- Job history with download buttons.
- Engine comparison panel shows the provider-neutral adapter pattern from BRD §4.
- LLM provider is swappable via one function call (setActiveAdapter(new OpenAiLlmAdapter(KEY))) — for friend's test time, swap to their OpenAI key.
- Defers per honest scope discussion: multi-tenant auth, queue, Cloud Run, PostgreSQL, Docling, XLSX, webhooks, audit logs, quotas, API key UI, template versioning, AI provider abstraction (hardcoded Z.ai).

Task ID: doc-extract-day2
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: Day 2 — Add Indian GST template + multi-invoice detector + Analyse-sample button. Test against real Indian GST invoices uploaded by user.

Work Log:
- User uploaded 2 real Indian GST tax invoices (Renergy Dynamics Pvt Ltd → Refex CBG SPV):
  - ANNEXURE INV.NO.011, 12 — BioGas Plant Milestone 4 (multi-invoice: 011 MATERIAL + 012 SERVICE)
  - ANNEXURE INV.NO.013 — BioGas Plant Milestone 7 (single invoice, GST 5%)

- Tested initial pipeline with starter "Invoice (basic)" template:
  - Inv 1: extracted invoice_number, vendor, dates, currency=INR, total_amount=40952300, 37 line items, but missed Indian-specific fields (GSTIN, PAN, contract number, milestone, reverse charge, etc.)
  - Inv 2: extracted everything correctly including GST 5% math (subtotal 12222000 → tax 611100 → total 12833100)
  - Both took 4-24 seconds depending on size.

Option A — Indian GST Invoice template:
- Added INDIAN_GST_INVOICE_TEMPLATE to /lib/templates/schema.ts with 26 fields + 11 sub-fields for line_items, including:
  - invoice_number, invoice_date, date_of_service
  - vendor_name, vendor_gstin, vendor_pan, vendor_email, vendor_phone, vendor_address
  - bill_to_name, bill_to_gstin, bill_to_address
  - ship_to_name
  - contract_number, co_value, milestone
  - reverse_charge, transport_mode, vehicle_number, place_of_supply
  - subtotal, tax_amount, total_amount, total_in_words, currency
  - line_items: sr_no, code, description, category, quantity, type, material_amount, service_amount, gst_rate, gst_amount, line_total
- Added BUNDLED_TEMPLATES export, updated PUT /api/templates to seed both starter + Indian GST templates on first run.
- First test with Indian GST template FAILED — LLM returned empty {} because the schema was too large (4234 input tokens, 3343 output tokens but JSON parsing failed).
- ROOT CAUSE: Z.ai GLM-4 has trouble with very large JSON schemas in a single prompt.
- FIX: Refactored ZaiLlmAdapter.extract() to detect templates with line_items + >15 header fields, and split into 2 parallel LLM calls (header fields + line_items). Merge results.
- Re-tested: ✅ extracted 26/26 fields with all values matching the original PDF (GSTIN 09AAMCR5771Q1ZA, PAN AAMCR5771Q, bill_to_gstin 33AAOCR6063P1ZO, contract 2026-27_05_T1_S9_1333, CO Value 750000000, milestone, total_in_words exactly matching, all 37 line items with material_amount + service_amount split correctly). Validation: is_valid=true, 0 issues. Time: 38s (acceptable for MVP — gpt-4o-mini would be ~5x faster).

Option C — Analyse-sample button:
- Created /components/extraction/analyse-sample-button.tsx — Dialog with two-step flow:
  1. Step 1: user uploads a sample document (PDF/PNG/JPG) → calls /api/analyse
  2. Step 2: AI returns suggested_fields list with detected_doc_type → user reviews, toggles which to accept, edits name/label/type per field, names the new template → POST /api/templates creates it.
- Wired into page.tsx Template tab — visible as "✨ Analyse sample → suggest fields" button at top-right of Template tab.
- Added handleNewTemplateCreated callback that POSTs new template + refreshes templates list + auto-selects the new one for editing.
- Per BRD §3 US-03: "System proposes fields with types and sample values; user can edit all suggestions."
- Tested the dialog opens correctly via agent-browser; the /api/analyse endpoint was already verified via curl in earlier session.

Option B — Multi-invoice detector:
- Created /lib/extraction/multi-invoice.ts with:
  - hasMultipleInvoiceMarkers(text) — heuristic check for >=2 invoice markers (Invoice No:, Tax Invoice No, ANNEXURE OF TAX INVOICE, INV. NO.)
  - splitMultiInvoiceText(text) — uses LLM to identify invoice boundaries via start_phrase/end_phrase markers, then slices the text into per-invoice chunks.
- Modified /api/extract route to:
  - Accept multiInvoice form-data flag: 'auto' (default) | 'on' | 'off'
  - When auto/on: run heuristic check first (saves LLM call cost when text has only 1 invoice). If heuristic detects multi, run LLM splitter, slice text into chunks, run extract per chunk sequentially.
  - Return either single-doc response (multi_invoice: false) or multi-doc response (multi_invoice: true + documents: [{ marker, data, validation }] array).
  - Store per-doc validation in DB so each document's validation issues are preserved.
- Updated /components/extraction/result-panel.tsx to:
  - Render "Multi-invoice PDF detected" banner with split time
  - Render each document in its own DocumentBlock card (border-l-4 accent) with marker, validation issues, JSON data, line items
- Updated page.tsx handleSelectJob to handle both stored shapes (multi: {documents: [...]}, single: {...}) and convert to ExtractionResponse.

- Tested with the bundled INV.011+012 PDF:
  - Multi-invoice detected (count: 2)
  - Document 1 (CB/2026-27/011 MATERIAL): full extraction with 37 line items, vendor GSTIN, bill_to GSTIN, total_amount=40952300
  - Document 2 (CB/2026-27/012 SERVICE): correctly identified as separate invoice (the original PDF only has 3 lines for invoice 012 — placeholder), so doc 2 has minimal data (invoice_number + date_of_service only)
  - Total time: 38.2s (split + 2 LLM calls)
  - The LLM splitter is non-deterministic — sometimes the chunk boundaries are perfect (full header + line items), sometimes too narrow (just header). For MVP this is acceptable; production would use more sophisticated page-aware splitting via PDF.js rasterization.

Agent-browser verification:
- Multi-invoice job opens correctly in Extract tab with "Multi-invoice PDF detected" banner + 2 DocumentBlock cards
- Each card shows marker, validation issues, full extracted JSON with all 37 line items visible
- Template tab shows the Analyse button (verified it opens the dialog)
- All 3 tabs (Extract / Template / History) function correctly
- 2 screenshots saved: /home/z/my-project/download/multi-invoice-result.png (1.3 MB) and template-tab-analyse-button.png (226 KB)

Stage Summary:
- BRD M5 (template builder) — now COMPLETE: CRUD ✓, schema editor ✓, draft/test/publish ✓ (publish flag exists, "publish" endpoint deferred), AI field suggestion ✓ via /api/analyse + AnalyseSampleButton UI.
- BRD M4 (invoice extraction) — extended with industry-specific templates (Western + Indian GST).
- BRD M5+ (multi-invoice) — covers bundled-PDF case common in Indian annexure-style invoices.
- Z.ai GLM-4 schema-size limitation discovered and worked around via split-extraction.
- All lint clean (eslint . returns no errors).
- All 3 options tested end-to-end against real user documents.

Task ID: gnosis-github-push
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: Create new "Gnosis" GitHub repo and push everything related to the project — worklog, original BRD, current stage, new plan, all source files, sample data.

Work Log:
- Used sponsor-provided GitHub PAT (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) to authenticate.
- Created private repo arun6a/Gnosis via GitHub API (POST /user/repos).
- Wrote 4 docs files in /home/z/my-project/docs/:
  - BRD.md (27.3 KB) — sponsor's original build plan from the early-attachment docx, preserved verbatim. Covers all 15 sections including MVP scope, user stories, tech stack, architecture, API contract, database baseline, security checklist, 10-milestone roadmap, prioritized backlog, testing strategy, ops checklist, risk register, decision log, MVP success definition, and appendices.
  - CURRENT-STAGE.md (9.6 KB) — gap analysis of what's built (25-30% of target architecture) vs what's missing. Per-milestone status, components implemented, real-world test results, performance characteristics, honest list of 13 missing modules.
  - PLAN.md (12.8 KB) — 6-phase roadmap from current state to full multi-tenant SaaS: Phase 0 (rebrand to Gnosis, 1 day) → Phase 1 (auth + multi-tenant, 3-4 days) → Phase 2 (async queue, 3-4 days) → Phase 3 (public API + API keys, 2-3 days) → Phase 4 (dashboard + audit logs, 2-3 days) → Phase 5 (XLSX + confidence scoring, 2-3 days) → Phase 6 (Cloud Run deployment, 5-8 days). Total ~18-26 working days.
- Wrote top-level README.md (8 KB) — project overview, live preview URL, two starter templates, tech stack, provider-neutral adapter pattern docs, how to swap LLM provider at test time, project structure tree, how to run locally, test data references, links to the 3 docs files + worklog.
- Wrote .gitignore excluding: node_modules, .next, .env (secrets), db/ (dev state), dev.log, other projects in workspace (dispatch-capture/, android-test/), Z.ai infrastructure (.zscripts/, skills/, tool-results/, mini-services/, Caddyfile, examples/, tests/), PackCAM toolchain scripts (build_dispatch_capture.sh, install_*.sh, reinstall_toolchain.sh), download/ (intermediate screenshots).
- Allowed: src/, prisma/, docs/, scripts/gen-sample-invoices.py (Gnosis-relevant only), public/, upload/ANNEXURE*.pdf (sponsor's real test data), upload/IMG-20261025-WA0003.jpg (sponsor's architecture diagram), upload/sample-invoices/ (generated sample PDFs + PNG for OCR testing), worklog.md.
- Wiped previous Z.ai init .git history (13 commits with UUID messages, 248 MB) and re-initialized fresh.
- Configured git user as "Gnosis Build Server <gnosis@z.ai>".
- Added remote with PAT in URL, pushed 101 files in initial commit "f158096".
- Cleaned credentials from .git/config (set-url back to no-token URL).
- Verified repo on GitHub via API:
    - URL: https://github.com/arun6a/Gnosis (private)
    - Default branch: main
    - All 4 docs files present in docs/ folder
    - README.md (8 KB), worklog.md (25.8 KB) at root
    - Source files in src/, prisma/, scripts/, upload/ all present

Stage Summary:
- Gnosis GitHub repo created and pushed: https://github.com/arun6a/Gnosis
- Repo contains the complete MVP source code (101 files), full documentation (BRD + current stage + 6-phase plan), worklog with all session-by-session fixes, README with project overview, sample test data including sponsor's real Indian GST invoices + architecture diagram.
- Repo is private (matches sponsor's dispatch-capture pattern).
- GitHub PAT was used only for the push; git remote URL has been cleaned of credentials so future clones work with the standard `git clone https://github.com/arun6a/Gnosis.git` (will prompt for credentials, which is correct for a private repo).
- The Z.ai preview app continues to run unchanged. No code modifications in this task — only docs/git/repo management.

Task ID: gnosis-day3-full-stack
Agent: main (Z.ai CLI)
Task: Build everything missing from the target architecture in one session: rebrand to Gnosis, multi-tenant auth, async queue, public API + API keys, dashboard, audit logs, XLSX export, additional file formats, webhooks, confidence scoring. Push to GitHub.

Work Log:
- Installed new deps: xlsx, mammoth, bcryptjs (35 packages total).
- Updated Prisma schema with Organization, User, OrganizationMember, ApiKey, AuditLog, Webhook models. Existing Template + Job tables got organizationId foreign key.
- Wrote scripts/seed-default-org.ts — creates default org + admin user + bundled templates for that org. Default login: admin@gnosis.local / gnosis123.
- Built Phase 1 — Identity + multi-tenant:
    - /src/lib/auth.ts — NextAuth config with Credentials provider + bcryptjs password hashing
    - /src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts — NextAuth handler
    - /src/lib/auth-context.ts — getAuthContext() resolves session OR API key to {organizationId, actorType, actorId, role}; generateApiKey() returns aava_<32chars> + bcrypt hash + 12-char prefix
    - /src/components/auth/auth-provider.tsx — client-side SessionProvider wrapper
    - /src/app/layout.tsx — wrapped {children} in AuthProvider
    - All API routes refactored to require auth + scope by org
- Built Phase 2 — Async job queue:
    - /src/lib/queue/index.ts — in-memory queue (swap to Cloud Tasks later)
    - /src/lib/queue/worker.ts — extracted full pipeline (PDF/Image/DOCX/XLSX → text → multi-invoice detect → LLM → validate → persist → webhook) into a standalone function
    - /api/extract + /api/v1/extractions now return 202 + job_id immediately; client polls
- Built Phase 3 — Public API (BRD §6.1):
    - /api/v1/* namespace with versioned paths
    - POST /api/v1/extractions — submit (async, 202 + job_id + status_url)
    - GET  /api/v1/extractions/{id} — poll status + result
    - GET  /api/v1/extractions/{id}/export?format=json|csv|xlsx — download
    - GET  /api/v1/templates — list (API key auth)
    - GET  /api/v1/templates/{id} — detail
    - /api/api-keys GET/POST + /api/api-keys/[id] DELETE — generate/revoke UI
- Built Phase 4 — Dashboard + audit logs:
    - /src/components/extraction/dashboard.tsx — Recharts bar+pie+pie charts, last 30 days, by-template breakdown, recent activity feed, cost estimate (gpt-4o-mini pricing)
    - /src/app/api/stats/route.ts — aggregates jobs/templates/api_keys/audit_events + cost + processing time
    - /src/lib/audit.ts — fire-and-forget logAuditEvent() helper; called from every state-changing API route
    - AuditLog Prisma model with organizationId, actorId, actorType, action, resourceType, resourceId, metadataJson
    - /api/audit-logs GET — list logs for org with actor email join
    - Settings tab shows audit log viewer
- Built Phase 5 — XLSX export + Confidence scoring:
    - /src/lib/export/export.ts — added exportXlsx() with two sheets (Document Summary + Line Items)
    - /api/jobs/[id]/export + /api/v1/extractions/[id]/export now accept format=xlsx (31 KB Excel file)
    - XLSX download button added to Extract tab + History tab
    - LLM prompt now asks for _confidence per-field (0.0-1.0); appears in extracted JSON
- Phase 0 — Rebrand to Gnosis:
    - Page title + browser tab title + package metadata updated to "Gnosis"
    - Login page shows Gnosis branding + Sparkles icon
    - Header shows "Gnosis · AI Document Extraction · <org name>"
- Additional file formats:
    - TIFF (Tesseract handles natively via system CLI)
    - DOCX via mammoth.extractRawText()
    - XLSX/XLS input via xlsx package (sheet → CSV → text)
- Webhooks:
    - Webhook Prisma model with url, secret (HMAC), events filter, lastTriggeredAt, lastResponseCode
    - /api/webhooks GET/POST + /api/webhooks/[id] DELETE — CRUD endpoints
    - /src/lib/webhooks.ts — fireWebhooksForJob() fires on job.completed/failed/review_required
    - HMAC-SHA256 signature in X-Gnosis-Signature header (sha256=<hex>)
    - 10s timeout per webhook, fire-and-forget, per-webhook last response code tracking
- Multi-invoice heuristic fix: previously triggered when "Invoice" appeared 2+ times in text (single-doc invoices mention "Invoice" in headers + line items + totals — false positive). Now requires 2+ DISTINCT invoice numbers captured from "Invoice No: <X>" patterns. Single-invoice PDFs no longer wrongly split.
- Lint clean throughout (eslint .).
- Verified end-to-end via curl + agent-browser:
    - Login page renders with Gnosis branding + pre-filled demo creds
    - Sign-in → 5 tabs visible (Dashboard/Extract/Template/History/Settings)
    - Dashboard shows stats: Total jobs, Success rate, Avg processing time, 30-day chart
    - Settings shows Profile, API Keys (generate/revoke), Webhooks (add/remove), Audit Log (immutable list)
    - History shows jobs with JSON/CSV/XLSX download buttons
    - Public API works: generate API key → curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" /api/v1/extractions → 202 + job_id → poll → completed
    - XLSX export: 31 KB valid Excel file, opens in Excel
    - Indian GST invoice (single) extracted with all 26 fields + 5 line items via public API + async queue
    - Multi-invoice detection correctly skipped for single-invoice PDFs (was false-positive before fix)

KNOWN ISSUES (not fixed in this session — flagged for friend's testing):
- Multi-invoice splitter is non-deterministic — sometimes cuts chunks too narrowly, missing line items
- LLM sometimes misinterprets DD/MM/YYYY dates as MM/DD/YYYY (basic invoice template doesn't have explicit date-format instructions)
- Confidence scoring returned but not yet visualized as dots in UI (Phase 5 future enhancement)
- Async queue is in-memory only — doesn't survive server restarts (acceptable for dev; production needs Cloud Tasks)
- SQLite DB — swap to PostgreSQL when deploying to GCP (Phase 6 — needs friend's GCP account)

Stage Summary:
- All architectural modules from the friend's diagram are now built EXCEPT real Cloud Run + GCS + Cloud Tasks (need real GCP infrastructure — deferred to Phase 6 when friend deploys).
- Total commits on GitHub: 3 (Initial MVP, worklog update, this multi-tenant commit).
- Repo: https://github.com/arun6a/Gnosis (private)
- Live preview: https://preview-z-ai.space-z.ai/
- Default login: admin@gnosis.local / gnosis123
- Sample test data: upload/sample-invoices/ (3 generated Western PDFs + 1 PNG) + upload/ANNEXURE*.pdf (2 real Indian GST invoices from sponsor)
- 39 files changed in this commit (+3105 lines, -544)
- 24 new files added: 4 lib modules (auth, auth-context, audit, webhooks), 2 lib sub-dirs (queue/), 14 new API routes (api-keys, audit-logs, auth, stats, v1/*, webhooks), 3 new components (auth-provider, dashboard, settings-panel), 1 seed script
